// ── A decoy HOME for the "honour DSH_HOME" tests ────────────────────────────
//
// DSH resolves its home as $DSH_HOME (blank means unset) else <os home>/.dsh. A bundle
// that hard-codes <os home>/.dsh only shows itself when DSH_HOME points somewhere else AND
// the real folder has something to read or to corrupt (a second profile, an isolated test
// instance, CI).
//
// This helper builds the scene such a bug needs in order to show itself:
//   · `home`    the OS home (HOME and USERPROFILE point at it);
//   · `decoy`   <home>/.dsh, seeded with canary files a bundle must never read, and
//               frozen so any change (created, edited or removed file) is reported;
//   · `dshHome` the folder $DSH_HOME points at, seeded with what the bundle SHOULD read.
// A test then runs the bundle and asserts that the answers come from `dshHome`, that the
// writes land there, and that `assertDecoyUntouched()` still passes.
//
// WHY THE BLOCK BELOW IS COPIED, NOT IMPORTED. The bundles ship their folder whole, tests
// included, and `scripts/` does not ship: a test that imports from here would break in the
// archive (scripts/test-paquet.mjs refuses a shipped module with a missing relative import).
// So every packages/*/test-dsh-home.mjs carries this exact block, and scripts/test-dsh-home.mjs
// fails if one drifts (the same arrangement as KB-SETTINGS-FILE in kybernos-sessions).
// Edit the block HERE, then copy it into each test.
